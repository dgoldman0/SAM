# System Notifications (Received by SAM in response to different events)

The system will be able to inject information through system notifications. Many of these notifications will be registered at the conscious level, but some may be registered at the subconscious level, if they are "background information" much the same way that people may subconsciously process background information but they might not register it consciously if they're not paying active attention. 

## Notification Types

- Waking Up
- User Connected
- User Disconnected
- New User Message

# System Commands (Ways for SAM to interact with the system and also beyond)

- Switch Active User
- Get Active User (Useful to remind AI of who they're currently speaking to)

# Parameter Tweaking

There's still a lot of testing to do to figure out which parameters seem to work the best. However, it might be useful to have dynamic parameters. Indeed, doing so can help produce various mental states, including deep focus, creative, etc.
