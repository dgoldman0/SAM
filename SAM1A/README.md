# SAM1A

SAM1A uses an alternative method of attempting to create persistent memory and context awareness, as well as inner dialogue that relies on storing connections between ideas in a memory map rather than by retraining the base language models. It includes a user layer and a conscious layer, as well as multiple subconscious layers.

## Memory

SAM1A uses a small persistent memory which is maintained as an ontology. It is expected that this approach will result in a less robust consciousness than repeated fine-tuning of the base model, but it solves the high cost problem associated with it. In the future, fine-tuning could be added on top of this model, and it may be a cleaner and superior option compared to the original design.
