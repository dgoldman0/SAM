# SAM1A

SAM1A uses an alternative method of attempting to create persistent memory and context awareness, as well as inner dialogue that relies on storing connections between ideas in a memory map rather than by retraining the base language models. It includes a user layer and a conscious layer, but no subconscious layers.
