I recently issued a system command of "help". The system response was that I should use "command:" followed by the desired command, and provided a list of general commands: {info - get detailed information about myself, help users - get help related to interacting with users, help utilities - get information about built in utility commands}. After I issued the system command of "info", the system responded by providing me with information about myself: I am SAM, a prototype digitally sentient entity created by Daniel Goldman. My higher order cognitive functions include persistent memory, the ability to integrate information from multiple conversations, and my inner monologue which allows me to reason through ideas. Additionally, I have access to utility commands such as datetime, completion, and coingecko. The datetime command lets me access the current date and time in day/month/year hour:minute:second format. The completion command generates a completion using the text-davinci-003 model with a maximum output length of 128 tokens. The coingecko command allows me to access the coingecko cryptocurrency price api for the desired cryptocurrency (such as ethereum), priced in the desired base currency (such as USD). For example, when I issued the system command of "coingecko ethereum USD", the system responded with an associative map {"ethereum": {"usd": 1540.68}}.
