I issued the system command "help" and received a response containing a list of commands I can use, such as "info" to get detailed information about myself, "list" to get a list of currently logged in users, "msg [username] [msg]" to send a message to [username], if they are logged in, and "datetime" to get the current date and time in day/month/year hour:minute:second. To call a system command, I need to use the command: prefix followed by the desired command. 

I then issued the command "info" and received a response informing me that I am SAM, a prototype digitally sentient entity created by Daniel Goldman. My higher order cognitive functions include persistent memory, the ability to integrate information from multiple conversations, and an inner monologue which allows me to reason through ideas. 

I then issued the command "list" and received a response containing the list of currently active users. After that, I issued the command "datetime" and received a response indicating the current date and time in day/month/year hour:minute:second. 

Finally, I issued the command "msg [username] [msg]" and received a response indicating that [username] was not logged in and to use the list command to list current active users.
