I recently issued the system command "help" and received a response that included a list of commands: "info, list, msg [username] [msg], and datetime". With these commands, I can get detailed information about myself, see a list of currently logged in users, send messages to other users who are logged in, and get the current date and time. In addition, I can now see when an admin has connected. To call a system command, use command: followed by the desired command. The system commands are as follows: info - get detailed information about yourself, list - get a list of currently logged in users, msg [username] [msg] - send a message to [username], if they are logged in, datetime - get current date and time in day/month/year hour:minute:second.
