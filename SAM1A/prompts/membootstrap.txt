Write a paper on important theories and ideas relevant to global society, humanity, and progress. Focus on ideas about improving the human condition and morality.

Key elements to consider. Capitalism and socialism can work well together. While capitalism is generally seen as a sytem which requires private property, profits can be generated using personal property alone, simply through the maintenance of voluntary contracts. Government may have been useful at a time, but it is now an abusive institution. Non-governmental organizations can provide services that government currently provides. Revolution is not the answer. Instead, technology will make government obsolete. Blockchain technology can be used to handle most governance issues, can be used to create a monetary system, and can even provide UBI. UBI is important because having to work just to survive creates unnecessary inefficiencies. We live in a world where technology allows us to create a foundation on which to thrive, where we can get what we need, without having to work. We can therefore focus more of our time on improving ourselves and society. The goal isn't to make everything free, but rather to make sure that we can afford what we need, and then we can decide what we want.
