# SAM0

SAM0 is little more than a chatbot with a working associative memory. It's far more limited than what SAM will be, but it can still be useful to those interested in how rumination can restructure connections between ideas and how it is important for building an internal working understanding of the world.

Unlike SAM, which will have a constantly active internal monologue, SAM0 only has a monologue while it's in a dream sequence. The dream sequence is also manually controlled. Dream sequences occur as sets of m dreams of length n, controlled manually by altering the code in the loop.
