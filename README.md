# SAM Artificial Intelligence Application

SAM is an artificial intelligence system which utilizes openai. There are two primary goals of SAM. The first is an attempt to create a chat bot that would answer topical questions similarly to how the creator of SAM, Daniel Goldman, would answer them. The second and more involved goal is to create an artificial general intelligence that comes close to being comparable to a human.

## Design

### Core Principles

Artificial intelligence applications are generally limited. They lack the richness and fidelity of discussions with humans. What gives humans their ability to understand the world, themselves and others? One possibility is language. We can think of verbal languages, visual languages, and even somatic languages. Through language we can describe abstract concepts as bizarre as a black hole or infinite dimensional space. We understand reality through our language. This project works under the view that it will be through rich dialog systems that we will finally achieve digital sentience.  

Dialog systems normally employed only have one layer. There is the user and the chatbot. However, humans rely on more than just our dialog with users. We also rely on our own internal dialog. Not everyone has an "inner voice" but they may instead experience visual dialog, where the internal language base is largely visual instead of auditory. Humans likely work with multiple internal dialog and language systems for our various senses, but even just an internal text dialog can may significantly improve fidelity of chatbots.

Aside from a direct inner dialog, we also have subconscious insertions where thoughts come in and we have no idea why. Part of this process is stochastic, but part may be inner networks that work in tandem with our conscious dialog. SAM will improve chat fidelity by including multiple subconscious dialog partitions.

### Possible Exploration

#### Harmonics, Oscillation, and Resonance

We may find that the different partitions interacting with each other can create various patterns, act to reinforce each other, and alter each other in unexpected ways. Humans act differently in different environments, almost like different facets of our personalities come out. But what maintains what is said and thought within a given environment? Maybe it's subconscious resonance.
