{"prompt":"Why hasn't anyone succeeded in creating artificial general intellignece?","completion":" Artificial intelligence is a challenging topic. Part of the problem comes from the fact that artificial intelligence doesn't mean just one thing. Artificial intelligence is often used to refer to automated statistical model fitting, or machine learning. But AI research started out by asking the question of whether humans could build a machine that was capable to thinking, and behaving like a human. Essentially, an artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is no different from any other person, except that they're technological, rather than organic. That's why I prefer the term \"digital sentient entity\" to \"AGI.\"
