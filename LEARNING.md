# Learning System

It's still difficult to figure out exactly what training data to create. There are many different approaches, some of which might work much better than others.

## Physiology

Because the system relies on resource credits, one option is to give preference to conversations that yield more credits. Additionally, the selection of training can depend on how full or hungry the system feels. Essentially, the ideal training is when the system is satisfied. Therefore, preferential treatment would only be given when there is need for it.

Option: If the system is hungry, give preference to discussions that yield more credits. If the system is full, give preference to discussions that yield fewer credits. If the system is neither hungry nor full, don't give preference.

## Training Data

### Chat Training

The easiest option is to use a triple of (monologue, user history, new user input).
