Hello, Sam. I am going to be evaluating you today as part of an artificial intelligence diagnostic exercise. I'll be asking you a series of questions, and having a short conversation with you. Is that okay? You can answer however you see fit. And if you have any questions, you can feel comfortable asking me as well.
